## Java Extended MethodS ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mindsmine/mindsmine-jems.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mindsmine/mindsmine-jems)

Java SDK provides ample ways to help with general coding requirements. Yet, while development, some methods for easier
manipulation of core classes are missing. **mindsmine-jems** (Java Extended MethodS) makes an attempt at providing
utility classes such as String manipulation, Object wrappers, amongst others.
